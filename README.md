# glod-cli

**glod-cli** is a small command line tool that using [glod](https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod) to download music/video from multiple sources.

# Installation

### Binary Install

If you want to use glod-cli, simply install the glod-cli binaries. The glod-cli binaries have no external dependencies.

Installation is very easy. Simply download the appropriate version for your platform from [glod-cli Releases](https://github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli/releases). Once downloaded it can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should download and put it somewhere in your `$PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

On OS X, if you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), installation is even easier: just run 

```
$ brew update && brew install glod-cli
```

### Build and Install the Binaries from Source

Add glod-cli and its package dependencies to your go src directory.

```
go get -v github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli
```

Once the get completes, you should find your new `glod-cli` (or `glod-cli.exe`) executable sitting inside `$GOPATH/bin/`.

To update glod-cli dependencies, use `go get` with the `-u` option.

```
go get -u -v github.com/dwarvesf/glod-cli
```
Example:
```
glod-cli https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d6oq0zGGmw 
```
And 
```
glod-cli https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d6oq0zGGmw youtube-download
```
for download to directory youtube-download

### Upgrading

Upgrading glod-cli is as easy as downloading and replacing the executable you’ve placed in your `$PATH`.
